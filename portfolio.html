                    <h3>From Moon</h3>
                    <p class="snippet">>Alone I stand, amidst the fray.
                        A lonely figure, lost in the way.
                        The world around me moves in glee.
                        But here I am, alone, you see........</p>
                    <p class="full-text">Alone I stand, amidst the fray.
                        A lonely figure, lost in the way.
                        The world around me moves in glee.
                        But here I am, alone, you see.

                        My heart aches for a friendly voice,
                        For someone to share my joys and poise.
                        But all I hear is silence, still,
                        A void that only deepens the chill.

                        The sun shines bright, but I'm in shade,
                        A lonely path that I must wade.
                        The crowds pass by, but none do stay,
                        Leaving me alone, to find my way.

                        Yet in my solitude, I find peace,
                        A chance to reflect, to find release.
                        For though I'm alone, I'm still alive,
                        And I'll find my way, as long as I strive.
                        ~Moon</p>

                    <h3>To My Love</h3>
                    <p class="snippet">>When I was down, feeling blue
                        You picked me up and carried me through
                        When the world felt like it was against me
                        You built a fortress, protecting me..........</p>
                    <p class="full-text">When I was down, feeling blue
                        You picked me up and carried me through
                        When the world felt like it was against me
                        You built a fortress, protecting me

                        Through thick and thin, you've stood by my side
                        Supporting me in every decision I decide
                        You've cheered me on in every success
                        And comforted me in every mess

                        In my darkest days, when the world felt grim
                        You were the shining light, the guiding hymn
                        You've made sure I'm stepping on the right stone
                        When the path is slippery and I'm all alone

                        Through laughter and tears and every emotion in between
                        You've been my constant, my rock, my dream
                        A bond that's woven with love and trust
                        A friendship that's pure, loyal, and just

                        As long as we have each other, we'll never be alone
                        Our friendship will always be a place we can call home.</p>

                    <h3>Yearning Of Childhood</h3>
                    <p class="snippet">In moments of quiet reflection,
                        We yearn for a time of pure perfection.
                        A place where life was simple and free,
                        And worries were few, like a shooting star's debris.......</p>
                    <p class="full-text">
                        In moments of quiet reflection,
                        We yearn for a time of pure perfection.
                        A place where life was simple and free,
                        And worries were few, like a shooting star's debris.

                        We remember childhood days that slipped away,
                        Where we learned to dream and laugh and play.
                        We felt the grass tickle our knees,
                        And saw the world with eyes carefree.

                        We rode the swings up high to the sky,
                        With the wind in our hair and a glint in our eyes.
                        We chased butterflies with our fictional wings,
                        And listened to sparrows chirp as they sing.

                        Our friends were our guide, our confidants,
                        And love was simple, without any wants.
                        We shared secrets under a fort of blankets,
                        And whispered our dreams, like silent love sonnets.

                        But now we find ourselves lost in thought,
                        For people and places we left behind, we sought.
                        Oh, how we long to feel that way again,
                        To banish worries and leave them in their lane.

                        Though we can't go back in time,
                        We keep those memories alive, sublime.
                        The innocence of youth brings us ease,
                        A lightness that calms our troubled seas.

                        We hold the spirit of youth close to heart,
                        And savour each moment, a precious work of art.
                        Although childhood days may be long gone,
                        Their lessons stay with us, from dusk until dawn.</p>

                        I'm Avani Joshi, a 20-year-old Computer Science Engineering student. I love writing because it
                        gives me a way to express myself better. I've been writing poetry since I was a child, and it's
                        always been a way for me to connect with my emotions and share my thoughts with others.

                        I'm passionate about using my poetry to make a difference. I've written poems about a variety of
                        topics, including love, loss, hope. I believe that poetry can be a powerful
                        tool for social change, and I'm committed to using my voice to raise awareness about important
                        issues.

                        I'm excited to share my poems with you on this website. I hope that you'll find something that
                        speaks to you. Thank you for visiting!</p>
